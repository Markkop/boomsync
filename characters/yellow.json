Any player that card or color shares with you joins the Yellow Team. New members of Yellow Team maintain their powers and conditions, but their allegiance (and therefore win condition) changes to Yellow Team. However, the YELLOW power does not work on primary characters (e.g. President, Bomber, Red Fist, etc.)."
